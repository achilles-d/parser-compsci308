Introduction:

We are trying to create a program using Java to simulate the Logo programming language. The Logo interpreted programming language allows users to control a “turtle” on screen and allows them to draw (or not) things using various commands. It was intended to teach programming to children and we want to replicate that functionality in our JavaFX program.

The large scale primary design goals of this program are to create a clean, easily expandable, and easy to understand code base that implements all the features required for the Logo programming environment. Our program should be most flexible in the addition of new features to the code. Programmers should easily be able to add new commands that add functionality without having to change multiple areas in the project. On the UI side, they should easily be able to change the look and feel (styling) of the project as well as add new custom panes that can display information that they wish to.

According to the open-closed principle, modules that are open are allowed to be extended and modules may be modified to behave in new and different ways. Some of what we want to be open are the command base options. We want to be able to add new commands easily to allow the user to do new and different actions to what already exists. Additionally, we want to keep the user UI information display panes open to extensions. There may be new information that a programmer may want to display and so these UI panes may be open to displaying this new information to the user. Closed code refers to source code that should not be modified in any way. While someone can add on to the command base, they should not be able to change the existing default commands in any way. With regards to the turtle, it should be open in the sense that someone can extend it to create a new turtle with maybe some visual changes. However, it should be closed in the sense that no one should be able to change or delete the existence of at least the original turtle.
Some of the UI components should be closed. There is no reason to change the command input box or the display square and so that source code should be closed.

At a high level, users will be able to enter commands using the LOGO language and execute them. The results of these commands could just be mathematical operations output in the console, or they could also animate the turtle in the main window. This could include moving the turtle, rotating the turtle, and also using the turtle to draw lines. Users will be able to configure the program to their liking, by changing the pen and background color, and also being able to change the image that is used for the turtle.
